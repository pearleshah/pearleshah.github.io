title: Vaccine Tracking Web App for Healthcare Providers
author: Pearle Shah, Rahul Barla, Anusha Shinde
abstract: Keeping track of personal medical information can be difficult for the average patient, particularly 
  after changes in healthcare providers and hospitals. This can be more burdensome for vaccine records because 
  the patient may not recall their entire specific vaccine history, which makes it harder for the healthcare 
  professional to have fully accurate information. The goal of our project is to mitigate this process. 
  Our GUI allows a healthcare provider to log in to a database and enter information for a specific patient. 
  The information that is entered will pertain to the vaccine that a patient will be receiving - the location 
  of administration, date, vaccine's lot number and name, reason for vaccination, and the vaccine administrator's 
  name - which will be stored in a database. The database will also enable a doctor to view information about a 
  patient's previous vaccine history by filtering the database via the patient's name (will populate a table 
  that shows the vaccine history for the patient).
